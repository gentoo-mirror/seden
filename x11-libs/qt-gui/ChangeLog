*qt-gui-4.8.0-r3 (10 Feb 2012)

  10 Feb 2012; Sven Eden <sven.eden@gmx.de> +qt-gui-4.8.0-r3.ebuild :
  This is a slightly changed ebuild to re-enable openGL. It is
  *STRICTLY* experimental and only meant to test OpenGL ES/EGL
  support, which is not usable (aka won't compile) with the original
  ebuild. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
