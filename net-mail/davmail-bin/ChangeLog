*davmail-bin-3.9.6 (21 Nov 2011)

  21 Nov 2011; Sven Eden <sven.eden@gmx.de> +davmail-3.9.6.ebuild :
  Re-added to my overlay, and renamed to davmail-bin. The unbundled
  version in the java-overlay causes too many problems on my system,
  I have therefore decided to keep the bundled (binary) version in my own
  overlay.
