*davmail-bin-3.9.6-r1 (23 Nov 2011)

  23 Nov 2011; Sven Eden <sven.eden@gmx.de> +davmail-3.9.6-r1.ebuild,
  -davmail-3.9.6.ebuild :
  Fixed some stupid errors. The old ebuild is obsolete.

*davmail-bin-3.9.6 (21 Nov 2011)

  21 Nov 2011; Sven Eden <sven.eden@gmx.de> +davmail-3.9.6.ebuild :
  Re-added to my overlay, and renamed to davmail-bin. The unbundled
  version in the java-overlay causes too many problems on my system,
  I have therefore decided to keep the bundled (binary) version in my own
  overlay.
