*ogre-1.9.0-r3 (03 Sep 2015)

  03 Sep 2015; Sven Eden <yamakuzure@gmx.net> +ogre-1.9.0-r3.ebuild,
  + files/1.9.0-03_move_stowed_template_func.patch,
  - ogre-1.9.0-r1.ebuild :

  Fix bug 559472


*ogre-1.9.0-r2 (29 Oct 2014)

  29 Oct 2014; Sven Eden <yamakuzure@gmx.net> +ogre-1.9.0-r2.ebuild,
  + files/1.9.0-01_remove_resource_path_to_bindir.patch,
  + files/1.9.0-02_remove_media_path_to_bindir.patch :

  Instead of sed'ing the wrong paths away, two patches now remove the
  parts in CMake/InstallResources.cmake that overwrote the correctly
  detected paths with build directory paths.

  GLES1 is gone for good, its support couldn't be compiled in anyway.
  See bug #418201 and bug #506058

  Usage of global variables was reduced to only one (MY_PV), as the
  paths set are used in src_install() only anyway since the sed'ing
  is gone for good.


*ogre-1.9.0-r1 (27 Mar 2014)

  27 Mar 2014; Sven Eden <yamakuzure@gmx.net> +ogre-1.9.0-r1.ebuild :
  - Updated to install the configuration file with correct paths into
  /usr/share/OGRE - the path where ogre searches for them.
  - Test path is /usr/local/share/OGRE
  - All paths linked into /etc/OGRE for backwards compatibility.
  - Added USE flags 'gles3' and'gl3plus', to add experimental support for
    OpenGL 3+ and OpenGL ES 3.0 support.
