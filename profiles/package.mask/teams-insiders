# Masked for removal at 2023-02-28
#
# Microsoft has removed all packages, as the electron app is "abandoned".
# Use PWA instead. Head to the teams.microsoft.com website in a PWA-friendly web browser
# (anything Chromium-based), sign in, and then wait for the “install” prompt to be shown.
# If the prompt does not appear, you can use the tools > ‘create a shortcut’ menu option.
